# Passage
Art installation piece for the Ontario Place Winter Lights festival 2020.

Passage is a journey through struggle, intention, transformation and illumination. A metallic structure invites visitors to pass through converging on them along the way.
The centre point is a moment of tension, resolving as travellers cross over. Passage rewards travellers who persist with a show of light.

# Implementation
Arduino sketch written in C++ for the passage art lights installation for the Ontario Place Winter Lights festival 2020.

The Arduino controls to 2 LED strips and an Ultrasound sonic sensor. The LED strips pass coloured lights through fibre optic cables that are woven in to the installation. Created a mosaic of lights to simulate the blending effects of cooling and warming lights. The ultrasound sensor is used to detect when an audience member passes through the installation and a display of pulsing lights are fired through the fibre optics to dazzle the audience.

# Implementation
Adafruit_NeoPixel library
